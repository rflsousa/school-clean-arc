# Simple project using clean architecture
Clean Architecture is a software development methodology that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of the components that make up a software system. It is a way of organizing code that prioritizes maintainability, testability, and scalability, and seeks to minimize the coupling between different parts of the system. Clean Architecture aims to create a system that is flexible and easy to change, and that can evolve over time without becoming bogged down by technical debt or other issues. At its core, Clean Architecture is about creating software that is focused on the business logic of the system, rather than on the implementation details of a particular technology or framework.
